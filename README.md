The admin part was left unfinished, as I unfortunately had no time left, even though I worked on it for full 3 weeks. All the main functions are however in place.

Also I have not realized how this much purple will look barbie-ish so I apologize for everyone's eyes

WARNING
JournalEntry commands have verification middleware. Deleting said function call will stop the commands from functioning properly.
First use the login command, copy the access token, and when using journalEntry commands, paste it into the bearer-token authentication.
This is so that the user ID is automatically set / used in the functions.
